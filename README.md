This is the Huffman Encoding Project assigned for EECS 233.
At some point I would like to actually like to write a file compressor
where the output file is not represented in readable "0" and "1" representation,
but stores true binary.

The reason it outputs character and not bit encodings is to conform with
requirements for the assignment.

I would also like to write a decompressor at some point in the future.
